# Harvard_DataMining_Business_Student
For students of Harvard CSCI E-96 Data Mining for Business

## Working with R
If you are new to R, please take an online course to get familarity prior to the first session.  We will still cover R basics but students have been aided by spending a few hours taking a free online course at [DataQuest](www.dataquest.com) or [DataCamp](www.datacamp.com).  The code below should be run in the console to install packages needed for the semester.

## Please install the following packages with this R code.
If you encounter any errors don't worry we will find time to work through them.  The `qdap` library is usually the trickiest because it requires Java and `rJava` and does not work on Mac.  So if you get any errors, try removing that from the code below and rerunning.  This will take **a long time** if you don't already have the packages, so please run prior to class, and at a time you don't need your computer ie *at night*.
```
# Individually you can use 
# install.packages('packageName') such as below:
install.packages('ggplot2')

# or 
install.packages('pacman')

               ggmap, leaflet, radiant.data, DataExplorer,
               vtreat, dplyr, ModelMetrics, pROC,
               MLmetrics, caret, e1071, plyr,
